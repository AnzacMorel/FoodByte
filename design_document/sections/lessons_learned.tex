The most important lesson I've learned from this project is the need for personal accountability for group work. This comes in many forms but having reliable means of communication and well organised meetings is very beneficial. As the project went on our test coverage got lower and I started to feel the effects and understand why test driven development is so so crucial. For more technical reflections see Section \ref{subsec:TechnicalDesignPost}.
