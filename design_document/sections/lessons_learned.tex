The most important lesson I've learned from this project is the need for personal accountability for group work. This comes in many forms but having reliable means of communication and well organised meetings is very beneficial. As the project went on our test coverage got lower and I started to feel the effects and understand why test driven development is so so crucial. For more technical reflections see Section \ref{subsec:TechnicalDesignPost}.

Key lesson 1:
The development of the GUI is not to be underestimated. Our original plan had only me assigned to developing the GUI as I believed that it would not be that hard as I had already done the JavaFX lab. This turned out to be doubly wrong as not only did I have to actually learn JavaFX, as the lab taught nothing but the fact that it existed and SceneBuilder basics, but the sheer quantity of work required for the GUI turned out to be collectively the same amount if not more than the back end architecture.
The lesson to be learnt from this is both that when learning a new tool it is better to assume you don't how to use it until proven otherwise and that the GUI will always be a very large part of any project.

Key lesson 2:
All the work that went into planning more than payed off. This can best be shown with the work that was put into planning the GUI. All of the sections that were well planned, mainly the operations side, were able to be rapidly developed and implemented to a high standard as there was already a template to follow. This can conversely be shown with details on the management side where there was little to no detailed planning. This caused several different minor variations of styles to occur, as well as struggles when considering where to put elements in the GUI as there was no pre thought towards leaving space for later elements.
The lesson that can be taken from this is that although planning can sometimes be a slog it is  more than worth the investment of time during the early stages.
