Order and menu operations were heavily tested with JUnit tests, this is because they provide the main operations for the application to fully function such as processing customer orders, or adding menu items to the menu. The functions used for these operations had a big chance of not being implemented properly, such as if an order is being modified, or the price of the menu item is being changed. Thus, it is vital to test the functions that help with these operations as they will greatly impact our application upon release.\\ \\
GUI controller classes does not have many unit tests written for them nor does any part of the GUI element of our app This is due to the fact that it is very difficult to test these classes, as there is just no viable way and efficient way to test these classes.GUI greatly impacts our test coverage as GUI accounts for a large part of the code in the system, thus these classes being not tested, greatly affects our unit test coverage as a whole. Without the GUI, our test coverage would greatly increase by a substantial amount.\\ \\
Some of the reference classes currently does not have any unit tests associated with them. This is solely because of the methods in these classes are mainly setters, and therefore does not provide a good reason to be tested. \\ \\
